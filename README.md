# web-afterhours

## Summary:
* A simple site to play the relevant 4 songs from the Martin Scorsese movie After Hours between 9pm and 6am.
* Check out the site at [dmdcb.com/afterhours/](http://dmdcb.com/afterhours/)

## Info:
* Developed on Chrome only really. Works on Firefox though too.
* Uses the same framework as my [homepage](https://github.com/mattixpet/web-homepage), i.e. jade, stylus and php.
* To change the code, the suggested method is changing .jade files in **afterhours/templates** and .styl file in **afterhours/styles** and after each change you have to run **afterhours/compile.bat** to compile .jade and .styl into .html/.php and .css respectively.
* Wrote about this project at [my project site](http://adobeslabs.herokuapp.com/projects/3/).
